# CS-370

-Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?

    -For this project, I was tasked with completing a Deep Q-Learning model to solve a treasure maze game. I was provided with a skeleton code and a certain dataset which included the maze and its properties, the agent and its possible actions, and some auxiliary functions for running a game, checking completion, and visualizing the game state. The main task was to complete the Q-Training algorithm, which involved designing the deep learning model architecture, implementing the Q-Learning logic, including experience replay, epsilon-greedy action selection, and updating the Q-values, and training the model with the proper inputs and targets. I completed this task by applying the principles of reinforcement learning, neural networks, and game theory.

  -What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
  
      -Computer scientists solve complex problems by leveraging computational power and algorithms. They develop software applications, design computational systems, analyze data to derive meaningful insights, and innovate in areas like AI, machine learning, cybersecurity, and more. The work of computer scientists matters because it drives technological advancements, enables efficiency and automation across various sectors, aids in solving complex societal problems, and contributes to the evolution of digital society.

  
  -How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
  
      -As a computer scientist, problem-solving is a process that often starts with understanding and defining the problem precisely. Then, it's about designing an efficient approach or algorithm to solve the problem, often considering time and space complexity. Once a solution is designed, it is implemented in code and then tested thoroughly to ensure correctness. Throughout this process, it's important to stay abreast of current best practices, technologies, and tools that can aid in solving the problem.
  
  -What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
  
      -As a computer scientist, I have a responsibility to ensure that the software or system I design is secure, reliable, and user-friendly. It's crucial to respect the privacy and personal data of users, adhering to all applicable data protection regulations. I must also ensure that the solutions I develop meet the needs of the organization, are economically feasible, and align with its strategic goals. Additionally, it's important to acknowledge and mitigate any biases in algorithms or data to ensure fair and equitable outcomes. Finally, it's my responsibility to contribute to a culture of transparency, collaboration, and continual learning within the organization.
